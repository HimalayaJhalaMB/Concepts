# Questions and Responses

### Question 1: what was the most interesting story or idea for you (BJ Fogg's TEDx talk)?

The most interesting idea in BJ Fogg's TEDx talk is the concept of starting with "tiny habits" to achieve lasting change. The simplicity of beginning with manageable actions, such as flossing one tooth or doing a single pushup, stood out. It reduces the overwhelming nature of larger goals and builds confidence through small wins. The Fogg Behavior Model effectively illustrates how these tiny actions lead to significant, sustainable transformations.

### Question 2:How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?

The formula B = MAP (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt) simplifies habit formation:

- M (Motivation): The desire to perform the behavior. Choose habits aligned with your values to maintain motivation.
- A (Ability): The capability to perform the behavior. Simplify habits to reduce effort, like flossing one tooth instead of all teeth.
- P (Prompt): The trigger to initiate the habit. Pair habits with existing routines, such as flossing after brushing your teeth.

Optimizing these three elements reduces friction, making habits easier to adopt.

### Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?


Celebrating after completing a habit is essential because it reinforces the behavior and increases the likelihood of repeating it. Key reasons include:
1. Positive reinforcement: Builds a strong emotional association with the habit.
2. Boosts motivation: Feeling successful encourages consistency and growth.
3. Strengthens neural pathways: Celebration hardwires the habit into your brain.
4. Creates success momentum: Encourages self-confidence and continued effort.

Celebration transforms small wins into meaningful achievements, embedding them in your routine.

### Question 4: what was the most interesting story or idea for you (James Clear, 1% Better Every Day)?

The concept of marginal gains stood out. James Clear's example of British Cycling, where 1% improvements in various areas led to remarkable success, highlights the transformative power of small, consistent actions. The idea that improving by just 1% daily results in being 37 times better in a year is compelling and emphasizes the importance of habits in achieving extraordinary outcomes.

### Question 5: What is the book's (Atomic Habits) perspective about Identity?

The book emphasizes identity based habits for long-term change. Each action is a "vote" for the type of person you want to become. For example, instead of focusing on "losing weight" (outcome), shift to "I am a healthy person" (identity). This shift aligns habits with self-image, enhancing intrinsic motivation and making habits sustainable.

### Question 6: What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

To make habits easier:
1. Reduce Friction: Simplify the steps, such as laying out workout clothes.
2. Use the Two-Minute Rule: Start with a tiny version of the habit (e.g., one push-up).
3. Optimize the Environment: Arrange surroundings to support the habit (e.g., place a book on your pillow).
4. Focus on Repetition: Consistency is more important than perfection. The goal is to make starting effortless.

### Question 7: What is the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?


To break bad habits:
1. Increase Friction: Add obstacles, such as logging out of accounts.
2. Use Commitment Devices: Set up tools that make the habit difficult, like website blockers.
3. Redesign the Environment: Remove cues for the habit (e.g., keep snacks out of sight).
4. Make it Unsatisfying: Reflect on the negative impact and share accountability with someone to discourage the behavior.

### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps you can take to make the cue obvious, the habit more attractive, easy, and/or the response satisfying?

Habit: Reading more books.

Steps:
1. Make the cue obvious: Place a book in a visible spot and pair reading with an existing habit.(morning tea).
2. Make the habit attractive: Choose exciting books and create a cozy reading environment.
3. Make the habit easy: Start with a small goal like 10 minutes a day and keep the book accessible.
4. Make the response satisfying: Track progress, celebrate small wins, and share insights with others.

### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps you can take to make the cue invisible, the process unattractive or hard, or the response unsatisfying?


Habit: Spending too much time on social media.

Steps:
1. Make the cue invisible: Turn off notifications and move apps to less visible spots.
2. Make the habit unattractive: Reflect on time wasted and its negative effects.
3. Make the habit hard: Use blockers, log out of accounts, or keep your phone in another room.
4. Make the response unsatisfying: Reflect on unproductivity after scrolling and have an accountability partner to discourage the habit.
