### What is a Firewall?  

A network security system designed to manage the flow of data from your devices to networks, 
a.k.a. the internet. A screen that operates based on a defined set of security rules, monitor and administers incoming data for viruses or hackers while allowing secure data to pass through.

### Key Objectives: 
To secure ourselves from:

- Private information: being targeted by hackers and scammers.  
- Malware/Viruses: aiming to damage your system.  
- Unauthorised usage: of system resources for mining or accessing private files.  

### How Does a Firewall Work?  

From network layers 3 and 4 primarily, where at 3 it is based on IP addresses, and at 4 it manages active connections, but it extends to layer 7.

- Data Packet Analysis: Here, content, origin, and destination are checked.  
- Block Criteria: Compared with other blocked packets.  
- Administer: Based on rules to filter out or allow the data.

## Types of Firewalls  

- Cloud Firewall: A firewall hosted remotely that provides protection to cloud-based applications and infrastructure.  
- Network-Based: Can be hardware or virtual, it could be a physical device in the midst of outgoing packets and the internet, or as simple as individual software on virtual machines.  
- Host-based: Laptops and devices with in-built firewall software.
- Next-Gen Firewall: Designed for businesses, data centers, etc., it performs deep packet inspection to detect suspicious activity.

### Limitations:
- Computation Intensive: Next-generation firewalls may require extensive computing resources.  
- Trusted Network: Suspicious activity within a trusted network can still cause a breach.

### Real World Use Cases
- Personal  
- Public  
- Businesses
