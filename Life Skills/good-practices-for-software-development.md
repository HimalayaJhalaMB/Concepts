### Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

Several points stood out as new and insightful to me:

1. Over-communication practices:
   I hadn't fully realized the importance of proactively informing the team about changes, unexpected issues, or even minor disruptions like internet outages. The suggestion to use group chats instead of private messages ensures better visibility and faster resolutions.

2. Using GitHub Gists and sandbox environments:
   While I've shared code snippets before, using tools like GitHub Gists or online sandboxes such as CodePen and CodeSandbox for better clarity is a great takeaway. It makes it easier for others to reproduce and understand issues.

3. Deep work and managing distractions:
   The emphasis on preserving attention and the recommendation to block social media and non-work notifications during work hours was a fresh perspective. Tools like TimeLimit and Freedom sound like practical solutions to improve focus.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

I believe I need to improve in the area of "doing things with 100% involvement." Staying focused for extended periods, especially in a remote setting, can be challenging. 

### Ideas for improvement:

1. Creating a distraction-free workspace: 
   - I'll remove non-essential notifications and consider using focus-enhancing apps like Boosted to track my work sessions.  
   - Setting up a dedicated work zone at home will also help me mentally separate work and leisure.

2. Practicing deep work techniques:
   - I'll explore the book on deep work mentioned in the content and try techniques like time blocking to allocate uninterrupted hours for critical tasks.  
   - Using the "Pomodoro technique" might help me stay engaged while allowing short breaks to recharge.

3. Maintaining energy levels: 
   - I'll pay closer attention to my meals and ensure they are balanced to avoid energy crashes.  
   - Incorporating regular short exercise breaks, like stretching or a quick walk, will help keep me energized throughout the day.

By implementing these strategies, I aim to enhance my productivity and ensure a better work-life balance.
