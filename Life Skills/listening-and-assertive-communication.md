### Question 5: When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

I usually adopt a passive communication style in situations where it’s more important to listen and observe rather than express my own views, such as when I’m gathering feedback, resolving minor conflicts, or when others clearly need the space to share their thoughts. I find that being passive in these moments can help maintain harmony and allow me to understand different perspectives better. However, I ensure this doesn’t compromise the clarity of communication or the progress of important tasks.

### Question 6: When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?

I believe in maintaining a respectful and collaborative communication style at all times. However, in rare instances where immediate action is crucial such as ensuring deadlines are met or addressing critical issues. I might adopt a more firm and direct approach. My focus in such situations is not aggression but clarity and decisiveness to ensure the best outcomes. Even in those moments, I prioritize professionalism and a solution oriented mindset.

### Question 7: When do you switch into Passive-Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?

I consciously avoid passive-aggressive communication styles in my interactions, as I value open, honest, and respectful communication. If I ever find myself feeling frustrated or misunderstood, I take it as a sign to step back, reflect, and address the situation more thoughtfully. My focus is always on finding constructive ways to communicate and resolve issues, ensuring that everyone feel heard and respected.
